# Capstone_project
Snake Game using PyGame

 
 
 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Normal games often lack interactivity and engagement which in turn limits the learning experience when applying object-oriented programming (OOP).
The aim of this project is to design and implement an interactive Snake Game using PyGame to demonstrate applications of OOP principles — such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, while creating a fun and educational programming experience.

 
 
 OBJECTIVES

To design and develop a fully functional Snake Game using Python and PyGame.

To apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in structuring game components (snake, food, and game engine).

To implement user input handling, game logic, and collision detection.

To build a playable game with scoring, visual feedback, and potential for extension (levels, speed increase, different snakes etc.).




TOOLS AND TERMINOLOGIES TO BE USED

Programming Language: Python 3.14

Library: PyGame (for graphics, events, and sound)

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub



 
 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY / APPROACH

Setup:

Create a Python environment and install PyGame.

Set up a GitHub repository with version control.

Design Phase (OOP Structure):

Define classes for Snake, Food, and Game using encapsulation.

Define relationships and responsibilities between objects.

Implementation:

Implement movement, collision detection and scoring logic.

Use PyGame for rendering the game window, graphics and event handling.

Apply OOP principles for cleaner and modular code.

Testing and Debugging:

Run and debug the game to fix logic and graphical issues.

Test for other cases like collisions with the wall or the user colliding into themselves.




EXPECTED OUTCOMES

A fully functional and interactive Snake Game built with Python and PyGame.

Demonstration of OOP principles in a real-world project.

Experience with game development fundamentals such as event handling, rendering and animations.

A well-documented GitHub repository showcasing my ability to plan, design and implement a complete Python application.
