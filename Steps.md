I had to use pygame-ce cause the standard pygame package (version 2.6.1) does not yet have pre-built binary wheels available for Python 3.14 which is the one i was using and didn't want to downgrade 
pygame-ce is a community-maintained fork which is fully compatible with standard Pygame code.
The game saves top 10 scores
